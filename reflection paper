CSCI 130 REFLECTION PAPER
This course has been really helpful for me in particularly in understanding how the web works behind the scene on servers and how the apps on web are handled and created. Being from a non programming background(Electronics) this course really introduced me to the working and complexity of web. 
In the beginning the course introduced me to HTML and CSS which i knew earlier but didn't have experience on. Prof. Todd explained the best practices and methodology of web pages at the front end and how to make them more interactive and easy to manipulate using CSS. 
Then we started working on GO language which is a new language used on web developed on Google for making saleable and dynamic websites. We learned the basics of the language through examples and interactive assignments to apply what we have learned which i thing is a great way of learning by doing. This course introduced me to Git-hub and Google App Engine services which both are an important part of developing web apps .
In this course i learned to make dynamic scalable professional level websites using Go language and deploying it using Google App Engine and providing secure login and data handling capabilities. After doing this course i think i now know the inner workings of the web and overall can start as web developer.
